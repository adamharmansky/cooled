The Cooler Ed

by the way i'm a bad programmer, this is just a small free-time project of mine, don't get mad if it doesn't satisfy all your fancy programer's standards :(


# goals
```Cooled should contain the following features:
  A better prompt, showing:
    the shape of the parentheses you are inside
    the number of indentations
  Dealing better with indentations, auto-indent
  Tracking unenclosed parentheses, custom partentheses like <html>, etc..
  when there's an error, the application calls you user-senpai and apologizes for the inconveniece
```
